Description
-----------

Arduino code for antenna rotator logic. For use with H-bridges and a 3-phase motor driven as a stepper. Tries to emulate a Yaesu GS-232A controller.

Quality of emulation is not yet verified, but the command interface works. Supports rotation to specific azimuth, fetching current position and speed control.

Lacks some work for supporting the commands related to elevation.
